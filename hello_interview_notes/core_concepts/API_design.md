# Ad hoc notes for API Design

## High level gists
1. For 90% of interviews, you'll default to REST. 
   1. It maps resources to URLs and uses HTTP methods to manipulate them. 
   2. Think /users/{id} for getting a user, POST /events/{id}/bookings for creating a booking. 
   3. REST is well-understood, works everywhere, and your interviewer will assume this unless you propose something else.
2. You should be able to sketch out 4-5 key endpoints in **a couple minutes** and move on.
3. If you're returning large result sets, you'll need pagination. 
   1. Cursor-based works better for real-time data where new items get added frequently, 
   2. but offset-based is fine for most cases. 
   3. For authentication, use JWT tokens for user sessions and API keys for service-to-service calls. 
   4. And if your system could get hammered by bots or abuse, mention rate limiting. 
   5. But don't go deep on any of these unless the interviewer specifically asks.
